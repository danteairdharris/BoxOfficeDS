# Box Office Predictive Model
## Project Overview
This simple WebApp productionizes a Box Office predictive model that runs underneath it to predict the Total Box Office of a film with a mean absolute error of ~ $45 Million. Production companies and individuals can use this model to evaluate the performance of a film at the Box Office.

## Data Collection
I used Beautiful Soup python library to built a script to scrape the relevant data from Wikipedia and Box Office Mojo. With each movie, the following data was scraped(if applicable):
* Title
* Producer/Director
* Cast
* Language
* Country 
* Release Date
* Running Time
* Budget
* Box Office
* Opening Box Office
* MPAA Rating
